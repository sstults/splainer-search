# Progress: Splainer Search

## What Works
- Project initialization complete with all core memory bank files created
- Clear understanding of project scope and requirements
- Well-defined architecture patterns and system design
- Comprehensive documentation of project context and technical decisions
- Proper separation of concerns in the documentation structure

## What's Left to Build
- Development environment setup (pnpm, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier)
- Core domain objects implementation (Doc, Searcher)
- Transport layer implementation (HttpTransport, JsonpTransport)
- Engine adapters implementation (SolrAdapter, ESAdapter, VectaraAdapter, CustomApiAdapter)
- Public API factory creation
- AngularJS compatibility wrapper
- Comprehensive test suite
- Build configuration and documentation

## Current Status
The project is in the initial planning and documentation phase. All memory bank files have been created and properly structured. The system architecture is well-defined with clear patterns and relationships between components. The technical context is established with proper tooling and dependency information.

## Known Issues
- No implementation code exists yet - this is purely documentation work
- Need to set up actual development environment and start coding
- Some components may need refinement based on implementation details
- API design may require adjustments during actual implementation

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial decision to use ESM modules was confirmed as appropriate for modern support
- Choice of Vitest for testing was validated as a good fit
- Architecture patterns were confirmed to be suitable for the requirements
- Backward compatibility requirements were clearly defined and understood
